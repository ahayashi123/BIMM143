Here we analyze a candy dataset 

```{r}
candy<- read.csv("candy-data.csv",row.names=1)
candy
```
Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?
Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?
Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?
Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
#View(candy)
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

```{r}
x<- c(5, 3,4,1)
sort(x)
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds<- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,])
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

>Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?
>Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?
>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy, aes(winpercent))+ geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```
```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=15)
```

>Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?
No it is not. It is skewed.
>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?
The center is below 50%
>Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

First find all the chocolate candy and their $winpercent values 
```{r}
choc<- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]

choc
```

Next summarize these values into one number 
```{r}
summary(choc)
```

Then do the same for fruity candy and compare numbers 

```{r}
fruity<- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]
fruity
summary(fruity)
```
On average chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruity candy. 

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc, fruity)
```
The difference between chocolate and fruity candy is significant. 

Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?
Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy))+
  geom_col()
```

Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent))+
  geom_col() + labs(y=NULL, x= "Win Percent")

ggsave('barplot1.png',width=7, height=8)
```

Add some color to our ggplot. We need to make a sutom color vector 

```{r}
#start with all black colors
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
my_cols

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy)+
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent))+
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) + labs(y=NULL, x= "Win Percent")
```

Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?
sixlets 
Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?
Skittles 

```{r}
candy$pricepercent
```

If we want to see what is good candy to buy in terms of winpercent and pricepercent we can plot these two variable and then see the best candy foor the least amount of money

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

# 5. Explorng the Correlation Structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)
cij<-cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```
Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?
Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?


# On to PCA

The main function for this is called 'prcom'  

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```

Plot my main PCA score with ggplot 
```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```
```{r}
p<-ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)
```
```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```


```{r}

```

```{r}
loadings<- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(loadings)+
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1))+
  geom_col()
```
