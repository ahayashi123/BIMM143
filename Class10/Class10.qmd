#The PDB Database 

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of the biomolecules structures- the PDB. 

Get a csv file from the PDB and read it in R

```{r}
pdbstats<- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
head(pdbstats)
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My pdbstats data frame has number with commas in them. This may cause problems.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)
```
```{r}
x<- "22,200"
as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
```
We found a function called 'gsub' now we can figure out how itt works 
```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
gsub(",","", pdbstats$X.ray)
```
I can turn this snipit into a function that I can use on every column
```{r}
commasum<- function(x){
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)

```
```{r}
totals<-apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
```
```{r}
round((totals/totals["Total"]*100),2)
```
84.54% are solved by x-ray and 8.72 is solved by EM. 

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(215684/249751891*100)
```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

# 2. Visualizing Protein Structure 

We will learn the basics of Mol*. Home page is https://molstar.org/viewer/ 

we will play with PDB code 1HSG

Show the ASP 25

## Back to R and working with PDB structures 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv<- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Here we will do a normal mode analysis (NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase pretein 
```{r}
adk<- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes<- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "move" called a trajectory of the predicted motions:

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

The you can open it in R
